# Capstone: Categorization of Credit Card Buying Behaviors

The purpose of this project was to use various clustering techniques to categorize unlabeld data from various credit card users.
Finding patterns in buying behavior is crucial for the financial industry. You could use these summaries to target special features
or services to each customer based on the relationships shown in these clustering algorithms. Being able to classify different
customers into groups can highlight more financially savvy individuals from your impulsive buyers which can be used to factor in things
such as interest rates on credit cards or loans for those individuals. It is also a good basis for creating risk profiles for different customers
without necessarily needing to know too many specifics about that person's personal life.

The results showed that different clustering methods produced slightly different classification results, but ovorall did a nice job in differentiating
individuals into specific groups with identifiable buying behaviors. More specific results are summarized at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
